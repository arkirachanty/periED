			<h2>Flirt Fight Gone Wrong!</h2>
        	<p>"I was pretend fighting with my boyfriend in his living room and when he gave up, I decided to sit on his stomach to show that I won. We laughed and just stayed there for awhile, because we were so tired. When his mom came home she asked why his belly button was bleeding! I had bled on his stomach!"<i>—Ali, 20, WA</i></p>

			<h2>Tampon Run!</h2>

			<p>"I had to go to the bathroom really bad at a party, but there was a huge line. I tried to wait, but had to go so bad that I asked everyone in line if I could cut to the front. When I got in, I realized I had just gotten my period! I had to stick my head out of the bathroom door to ask if anyone had a tampon—and my crush was first in line! He ended up finding me one, but it was super mortifying." <i>—Ashlee, 17, PA</i></p>

			<h2>I Got My Period In The Store!</h2>

			<p>"When I was trying on jeans at a store, I got my period and blood got on the jeans. I tried to rush out of the dressing room to put them back, but right away a girl asked me if she could try them on. I handed them off to her and got out of the store as fast as I could!" <i>—Liz, 15, MI</i></p>

			<h2>Is it a BandAid?!</h2>
			<p>My guy friend was flipping through my backpack to borrow a pencil but pulled out a pad and tampon instead! We were in an AP Computer Science class and 90% of the class were guys- the room was virtually silent as he held up the pad and loudly asked “Hey, why do you have a giant band-aid?” <i>- Linda, 17, WA</i></p>
