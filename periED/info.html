			<p>Let's be real right now, periods can be kind of freaky, and even in this advanced day and age with our gay marriage rights and high-tech Japanese toilets, periods are still stigmatized. As an all girl team, we totally feel the struggle of not knowing what to do when you first get your period, and feeling super uncomfortable for a full week, even after having your period for years. Here, we're hoping to help break the stigma around periods and we want to offer some of the realest advice for girls when it comes to dealing with Mother Nature.</p>
		</div>
			<h2>"What's Happening To Me Exactly???"</h2>
			<p>Basically, women have uteruses that have a lining around them and the menstrual period is the body shedding that lining. You know what also sheds part of its body? SNAKES. And snakes are rad as heck. So are you. Anyways, every month-ish, the uterus’ lining gets thicker and if the woman isn’t pregnant, the body will release the lining as blood through the vagina. This might sound kind of scary, but it’s honestly one of the most normal things for women’s bodies to do; it’s as normal eating and breathing. And I mean come on, you’re bleeding for days and it’s not even a big deal.<i> Bad. Ass.</i></p>
			<h2>Common Period Problems</h2>
			<p>First things first, having a period doesn't hurt. And it lasts for about a week.<br>
			<br><b>BUT</b> some girls will experience cramps during their period, and I won't lie, they're not usually a lot of fun. You've just got to power through and Netflix it out or lie down with a hot water bottle and relax, honestly. Let's talk about what you can do to help ease the pain so you can actually get up and get out there.
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
			<br><li><p>Lay down & Hot water bottle that-</p></li> I wasn't joking about the Netflix; lay down, prop your feet up with a few pillows, and set a hot water bottle on your stomach. I've watched many a cat video and followed lots of Tumblr accounts while doing this; laying down and relaxing really helps.<br>
			<br><li><p class="problems-list">Painkillers-</p></li> Medicine is great. When the cramps set in, I take Ibuprofen and/or Advil like it's a religion. These will help with mild cramps and they can ease up severe cramps.<br>
			<br><li><p class="problems-list"><b>DON'T</b> go for caffeine-</p></li> It's just not a good idea.<br>
			<br><li><p class="problems-list">Birth Control Pills-</p></li> If your period is really cramping your style, (ba-dum-ch), you might want to consider birth control pills. These can lighten periods and make them more regular. Talk to your doctor before you use these though; you're going to want their advice on which specific pills to take.<br>
		</ul><br>
		<p>PMS is also a thing. It's Premenstrual Syndrome, and it's the term for those not-so-fun physical and emotional changes right before periods. Some girls don't experience it while some do. Either way is normal, and this is just a heads-up of what you might experience. These symptoms usually show up a few days to a week before the period starts, and they'll go away when the period actually starts, so no worries.</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<br><li>Acne<br></li>
			<li>Bloating<br></li>
			<li>Mood swings<br></li>
			<li>Headaches<br></li>
			<li>Soreness (like in the back or chest areas)<br></li>
			<li>Sleep trouble<br></li>
			<li>Food cravings<br></li></p>
		<h1>Common Concerns</h1>
			<ul style"list-style-type:disc">
			<br><li><p>Period Appearance</p></li>
Brown-colored blood or watery/light-colored discharge is totally normal.
Green-colored blood means you should see a doctor. This could indicate an infection or STD.
*Period Pains
If your cramps are so bad that they’re causing you to miss out on school because you simply can’t get up, you should see a doc. They may recommend birth control pills to you, which can ease up the cramps and make periods lighter.
*Period Regularity
If you’re going through a tampon or pad in less than an hour, for multiple hours, see a doctor. That’s a lot of blood, girl, and losing that much blood in such a short amount of time is a bit concerning.
It can take months if not years for periods to be normal. (Normal meaning it comes at the same time, every month). Don’t worry if your period comes at different times over the months.
Having a period and then spotting afterwards for another week is not out of the ordinary. Just wear a liner until the spotting disappears.
*Product Use
How to insert a tampon:
There’s tons of videos online explaining how with illustrations. We recommend using a mirror to figure out where your vagina is. You may be uncomfortable at first and think I just don’t have a vagina, I swear I don’t but chances are, you do. Don’t be shy, this is your body!
Try tampons with plastic applicators on the first time. They’re the easiest to insert.
Angle the tampon towards your back, not horizontal to the floor (if you’re sitting down).
Inserting a tampon doesn’t mean you’ve lost your virginity.
Note: Toxic Shock Syndrome is very real. The risk of it is really low when tampons are inserted properly, but you’re putting yourself at risk if you sleep with a tampon in. Change tampons every 4-8 hours!
Use the lowest necessary absorbency for your period.
*Can and Can’ts
You can get pregnant if you have sex while on your period.
You cannot currently be pregnant while on your period. Your uterus is shedding it’s lining because there isn’t a fertilized egg present, after all.
You can participate in any sport while on your period, including swimming (use a tampon). For more than moderate exercise, you should use feminine products that are for sports.
