				<h1>Information about Periods!</h1>
				<p>Let's be real right now, periods can be kind of freaky, and even in this advanced day and age with our gay marriage rights and high-tech Japanese toilets, periods are still stigmatized. As an all girl team, we totally feel the struggle of not knowing what to do when you first get your period, and feeling super uncomfortable for a full week, even after having your period for years. Here, we're hoping to help break the stigma around periods and we want to offer some of the realest advice for girls when it comes to dealing with Mother Nature.</p>
				<h2>"What's Happening To Me Exactly???"</h2>
				<p>Basically, women have uteruses that have a lining around them and the menstrual period is the body shedding that lining. Every month-ish, the uterus' lining gets thicker and if the woman isn't pregnant, the body will release the lining as blood through the vagina. This might sound kind of scary, but it's honestly one of the most normal things for women's bodies to do; it's as normal eating and breathing.</p>
				<h2>Common Period Problems</h2>
				<p>First things first, having a period doesn't hurt. And it lasts for about a week.<br>
				<br><b>BUT</b> some girls will experience cramps during their period, and I won't lie, they're not usually a lot of fun. You've just got to power through and Netflix it out or lie down with a hot water bottle and relax, honestly. Let's talk about what you can do to help ease the pain so you can actually get up and get out there.
				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				<br><li><p class="p2">Lay down & Hot water bottle that-</p></li> I wasn't joking about the Netflix; lay down, prop your feet up with a few pillows, and set a hot water bottle on your stomach. I've watched many a cat video and followed lots of Tumblr accounts while doing this; laying down and relaxing really helps.<br>
				<br><li><p class="p2">Painkillers-</p></li> Medicine is great. When the cramps set in, I take Ibuprofen and/or Advil like it's a religion. These will help with mild cramps and they can ease up severe cramps.<br>
				<br><li><p class="p2"><b>DON'T</b> go for caffeine-</p></li> It's just not a good idea.<br>
				<br><li><p class="p2">Birth Control Pills-</p></li> If your period is really cramping your style, (ba-dum-ch), you might want to consider birth control pills. These can lighten periods and make them more regular. Talk to your doctor before you use these though; you're going to want their advice on which specific pills to take.<br>
			</ul>
				    <br>PMS is also a thing. It's Premenstrual Syndrome, and it's the term for those not-so-fun physical and emotional changes right before periods. Some girls don't experience it while some do. Either way is normal, and this is just a heads-up of what you might experience. These symptoms usually show up a few days to a week before the period starts, and they'll go away when the period actually starts, so no worries.<br>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
				<br><li>Acne<br></li>
				<li>Bloating<br></li>
				<li>Mood swings<br></li>
				<li>Headaches<br></li>
				<li>Soreness (like in the back or chest areas)<br></li>
				<li>Sleep trouble<br></li>
				<li>Food cravings<br></li></p>
