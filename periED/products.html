				<h1>Products:</h1>
				<h2>Tampons</h2>
				<p>Tampons are soft cotton "plugs" inserted in your vagina to absorb your menstrual flow before it leaves the body. Yes, it may feel a little uncomfortable if you insert it incorrectly, (not to worry- you'll get it right quickly!) and no- tampons will not make you lose your virginity.<br>

				<br>Although tampons may take a while to get used to, the process is so worth it. Let's be real- you love swimming in lakes, and pads just don't cut it. Plus, they feel like giant diapers and worrying whether they can be seen through your LuluLemons is unnecessary paranoia no one has time for.<br>

				<br></b>Not to worry- tampons are here to help! These products can be sold at your local pharmacy or grocery store in all different sizes and absorbencies to match your needs. They come in cute packaging and colors so that you'll start looking forward to your next period. (Okay, we're exaggerating. But really. Tampons are great!) The best part is that you won't even feel an overwhelming rush every time you stand up because the cotton absorbs your blood before it exits your vagina. You can continue with your daily activities as if Aunt Flow isn't there- and yes, that includes swimming!<br>

				<br>Okay, enough raving about tampons. Here are some mini-reviews on great products that you can check out! --------GROUP REVIEWS---------</p>

				<h2><br>Pads</h2>
				<p>	Although a more "old-fashioned" way to deal with periods, pads have come a long way from the ancient Chinese method of stuffing sand into a handkerchief to store up blood (True story!) Today's pads are comfortable, easy to use, and reliable. They are fast, safe (no risk of TSS) and easy to use and change- unlike tampons, you won't get blood on your hands and if you're hemophobic, you can change pads without looking.<br>

				<br>In short, pads are rectangular cotton material that you stick to your underwear to soak up your blood after blood leaves your vagina. Many modern day pads have additional "wings" on the side, extra material that you fold over the sides of your underwear to further prevent leaking. Similar to tampons, they come in all absorbencies and sizes (lengths)  that you can find at your local pharmacy or grocery stores. Not to worry- many pads today are papery thin (you can barely tell they're there) yet extremely absorbent and reliable.<br></p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th><center>Pads</center></th>
						<th><center>Pros<center></th>
						<th><center>Cons<center></th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th><img src="media/always.JPG" style="width:150px; height:150px;"></th>
						<th>Added length for better overnight protection<br>
				Immediate sense of loving safety<br>
				Wings for extra support<br>
					</th>
						<th>Fairly thick pad; noticeable when you wake up<br>
				No guarantee of complete protection if you have very heavy flow (but then again, nothing can guarantee complete protection)<br></th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th><img src="media/maxi.JPG" style="width:158px; height:168px;"></th>
						<th>Extremely thin- absorbs 4x its weight! (Wowow technology)  You can barely tell it's there.<br>
				The pad makes exceptional use of its two foam layers- blood is quickly transferred to the bottom layer where it is stored. This way, the top layer remains dry and fresh so you don't get that icky I'm-sitting-on-my-own-blood feeling.<br>
				Foam is extremely soft<br></th>
						<th>On the more expensive side, as far as pads go.<br></th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th><img src="media/reusable.JPG" style="width:158px; height:138px;"></th>
						<th>Environmentally friendly<br>
				Cute designs<br>
				Comfortable and easy to use<br>
				Economic choice in the long run<br></th>
				<th> Needs to be washed after each use- relatively high maintenance<br>
				Does not provide immediate absorption like one-time use pads<br></th>

					</tr>
				</table>
				<br><h2>PantyLiners</h2>
				<p>You can think of panty liners as mini pads used when pads are considered too "excessive".Panty-liners generally replace pads near the end of your period, when you want a layer beneath tampon as added protection against leaking, or just when you have slight vaginal discharge (don't worry, this is normal!) They look like pads but are thinner and narrower in construction.</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th><center>PantyLinders</center></th>
						<th><center>Pros<center></th>
						<th><center>Cons<center></th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th><img src="media/poise.JPG" style="width:158px; height:158px;"></th>
						<th>Holds an entire ounce, so does not require to be emptied as often<br>
						Less leakage than tampons<br>
						Non-absorbent and does not dry out bodily fluids like tampons do<br>
						Economically friendly<br></th>
						<th></th>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<br><h2>Cups</h2>
				<p>Okay, now we're talking unconventional methods. Menstrual cups are the least common form of period protection because adults generally fail to publicize this product. Menstrual cups are way underrated tbh. They're environmentally friendly and comfortable with practice. Menstrual cups are flexible bell-shaped collectors that gather all of those lady liquids before they exit the body, thus providing similar benefits as tampons. They also have an added advantage of environmental friendliness and fewer health risks such as TSS and vaginal infections that come with repeated tampon usage. Menstrual cups are reusable and are emptied then washed before reinsertion.<br>

				<br>Because using menstrual cups generally require a certain level of skill, they are best used after you have had some experience with using tampons (insertion methods can be difficult when you first start your period!)<br>
				</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th><center>Cups</center></th>
						<th><center>Pros<center></th>
						<th><center>Cons<center></th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th><img src="media/diva.JPG" style="width:130px; height:170px;"></th>
						<th>Holds an entire ounce, so does not require to be emptied as often<br>
						Less leakage than tampons<br>
						Non-absorbent and does not dry out bodily fluids like tampons do<br>
						Economically friendly<br></th>
						<th>Similar to inserting a tampon but different at the same time<br>
						High startup cost.<br></th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th><img src="media/soft.JPG" style="width:120px; height:120px;"></th>
						<th>Long wear - up to 12 hours but depending on how heavy your period is.<br>
						Eco-frienly.<br>
						</th>
						<th>They can be very messy even if you are careful with them.<br>
						They leak especially when using the restroom.</th>
